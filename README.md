# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Implementation
Page 1 of 2Engineering Challenge - Web FrontEndBuild the web frontend client of an “Address Book” applicationImplementation

Details

Your web client should initially display the list of persons from the address book. The user should be able to select a person from the list in order to see more details about that person.

Please use the API endpoints from https://randomuser.me/ (Documentation can be found athttps://randomuser.me/documentation). Your client should be responsive.

Suggested UX hint:

● User should see the list of persons from the address book
● User should be able to select a person from the list and navigate to the details page
● User should be able to see the first name, last name, phone number on the details pageDeliverablesPlease take your time to deliver a quality solution that shows your ability.

Include:
● A README file that contains:
○ Deployment / running instructions. Assume that we’re running this on a Mac.Bonus points if instructions are for deployments to a distributed cloudinfrastructure
○ A summary of the assignment
■ Your overall approach
■ What features you implemented
■ Given more time, what else would you have liked to complete and how long it would have taken you?■ Given more time, what else would you have done to make the projectmore robust?

● Production-ready code that:

○ Your code checked into a git repository that can be shared with us (Github,Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc...). We should be able to run the code
○ Follows community standard syntax and style
○ Has no debug logging, TODOs, or FIXMEs
○ Has test coverage to ensure quality and safety

What we look for
● Clean code. Style we’re looking for: concise but descriptive.

● Enough functionality or code to show us your understanding of fundamental development practices

● Test coverage for your code. Bonus point if you are able to perform Test DrivenDevelopment

● Bonus points: Code in a functional, concise, declarative way. Things we will look for:higher-order functions, function composition, correct use of basic data structures andmanipulations (map, reduce, apply, etc.)

● Bonus points for managing asynchronous or concurrent execution through high-levelabstractionsPage 2 of 2
